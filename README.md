# MeraDataExtractor
This is the MÉRA Data Extractor Tool which can process the Met Eireann's MÉRA data-set and convert the raw data from GRIB format into “analysis/model ready” usable information in CSV format.

Here is the information about Met Eireann's MÉRA - https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/mera

This tool uses ecCodes [https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC] from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and its Python interface [https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC/Python+3+interface+for+ecCodes]
